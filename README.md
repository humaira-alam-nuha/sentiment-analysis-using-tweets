# sentiment-analysis-using-tweets
There are people who chose not to express what they are going through and not very vocal about their  feelings. Often people suffering from depression tend to use less words or just emoticons which are nonASCII characters to express their emotions. Also Itâ€™s quite a difficult task to  differentiate because the words or text data implied in a sentence come with a different sense of meaning  depending on the senders or situations. This project implements LSTM and CNN-LSTM for detecting  Tweets which demonstrate signs of depression and negative emotion.
